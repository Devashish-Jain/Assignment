# ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Verification Checklist

## üß™ **Test Everything Locally First**

Before deploying to production, ensure your application works perfectly locally:

### **1. Backend Testing**
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run build
npm start

# Should show:
# ‚úÖ Database connected successfully to SkySQL  
# üöÄ School Directory Server Started Successfully!
# ‚úÖ Server running on: http://localhost:8080
```

**Test these endpoints in browser:**
- [http://localhost:8080/health](http://localhost:8080/health) ‚úÖ
- [http://localhost:8080/api/schools](http://localhost:8080/api/schools) ‚úÖ

### **2. Frontend Testing**
```bash
cd client  
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview

# Should build successfully and serve on port 4173
```

**Test frontend functionality:**
- [ ] Home page loads with animations
- [ ] Add School form works
- [ ] School list displays properly
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] Images upload and display
- [ ] Counter-up animations work
- [ ] Mobile responsive design
- [ ] No console errors

### **3. Integration Testing**
With both services running locally:
- [ ] Frontend can communicate with backend
- [ ] CORS working correctly
- [ ] All API calls successful
- [ ] Database operations working
- [ ] File uploads working

## üìù **Code Quality Checklist**

### **TypeScript Compilation**
```bash
# Frontend
cd client && npm run build
# Should compile without errors

# Backend  
cd server && npm run build
# Should compile without errors
```

### **Linting (Frontend)**
```bash
cd client && npm run lint
# Should pass without warnings (or minimal warnings)
```

### **Environment Variables**
- [ ] All required environment variables documented
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] Database credentials working
- [ ] API URLs configurable

## üîß **Deployment Configuration Files**

Verify these files exist and are configured correctly:

### **Frontend Configuration**
- [ ] `client/vercel.json` - Vercel deployment config
- [ ] `client/package.json` - Build scripts correct
- [ ] `client/vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration

### **Backend Configuration**
- [ ] `server/render.yaml` - Render deployment config (optional)
- [ ] `server/package.json` - Build and start scripts correct
- [ ] `server/src/config.ts` - Production CORS settings
- [ ] `server/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compilation settings

## üìä **Database Verification**

### **SkySQL Connection Test**
```bash
# Test database connection manually
cd server
node -e "
const mysql = require('mysql2/promise');
const pool = mysql.createPool({
  host: 'serverless-us-central1.sysp0000.db2.skysql.com',
  port: 4057,
  user: 'dbpgf01458622', 
  password: '%a(y77HQkPtezYXA89b*K',
  database: 'defaultdb',
  ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }
});
pool.getConnection().then(() => console.log('‚úÖ Database connection successful')).catch(err => console.error('‚ùå Database connection failed:', err));
"
```

### **Database Schema**
- [ ] Tables exist (`schools`, `school_images`)
- [ ] Indexes created for performance
- [ ] Proper foreign key relationships
- [ ] Sample data can be inserted/retrieved

## üåê **Git Repository Preparation**

### **Git Status Check**
```bash
git status
# Should show clean working tree or staged changes ready for commit
```

### **Essential Files to Commit**
- [ ] All source code files
- [ ] `client/vercel.json`
- [ ] `server/render.yaml` (if using)
- [ ] `package.json` files
- [ ] `tsconfig.json` files
- [ ] Configuration files
- [ ] **Don't commit**: `.env` files, `node_modules/`, `dist/`

### **GitHub Repository**
- [ ] Repository created on GitHub
- [ ] Code pushed to main branch
- [ ] Repository is accessible
- [ ] README.md updated

## üîê **Security & Environment Variables**

### **Environment Variables Preparation**
Have these ready for deployment:

**Backend (Render):**
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=10000`  
- `DB_HOST=serverless-us-central1.sysp0000.db2.skysql.com`
- `DB_PORT=4057`
- `DB_USER=dbpgf01458622`
- `DB_PASSWORD=%a(y77HQkPtezYXA89b*K`
- `DB_NAME=defaultdb`
- `FRONTEND_URL=` (will be set after Vercel deployment)

**Frontend (Vercel):**
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL=` (will be set after Render deployment)

### **Security Check**
- [ ] No secrets hardcoded in source code
- [ ] Database credentials secured
- [ ] CORS properly configured for production
- [ ] No debug logging in production code

## üì± **Performance & UX Testing**

### **Performance Checklist**
- [ ] Database queries optimized (N+1 problem solved)
- [ ] Images loading efficiently
- [ ] Counter-up animations work smoothly
- [ ] No memory leaks or performance issues
- [ ] Responsive design works on all devices

### **User Experience**
- [ ] Loading states implemented
- [ ] Error handling in place
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] Intuitive navigation
- [ ] Form validation working

## üöÄ **Deployment Readiness**

### **Accounts & Access**
- [ ] Vercel account created and verified
- [ ] Render account created and verified  
- [ ] GitHub repository access confirmed
- [ ] Payment method added (if using paid plans)

### **Documentation Review**
- [ ] Read `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- [ ] Read `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- [ ] Read `DEPLOYMENT_ENV_VARS.md`
- [ ] Understand deployment order (Backend first, then Frontend)

## ‚ö° **Quick Deployment Simulation**

### **Simulate Build Process**
```bash
# Test frontend build (same as Vercel will do)
cd client
npm ci
npm run build
# Should create dist/ folder with built files

# Test backend build (same as Render will do)  
cd server
npm ci
npm run build
# Should create dist/ folder with compiled JavaScript
```

### **Environment Variable Test**
```bash
# Test with production-like environment variables
cd server
export NODE_ENV=production
export PORT=8080
export DB_HOST=serverless-us-central1.sysp0000.db2.skysql.com
# ... (set all other variables)
npm start
# Should start successfully with production config
```

## üéØ **Final Pre-Deployment Checklist**

- [ ] ‚úÖ All code committed to GitHub
- [ ] ‚úÖ Build processes successful
- [ ] ‚úÖ Database connection verified
- [ ] ‚úÖ Environment variables prepared
- [ ] ‚úÖ Deployment guides reviewed
- [ ] ‚úÖ Accounts created (Vercel & Render)

## ‚úÖ **Ready to Deploy!**

If all checks pass, you're ready to follow the deployment guides:

1. **Deploy Backend**: Follow `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
2. **Deploy Frontend**: Follow `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`  
3. **Update Environment Variables**: Cross-link the deployed URLs
4. **Final Testing**: Verify everything works in production

**Good luck with your deployment! üöÄ**
